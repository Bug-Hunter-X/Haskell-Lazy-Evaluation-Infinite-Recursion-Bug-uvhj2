This Haskell code attempts to perform lazy evaluation with an infinite list, but it fails to terminate properly due to an unintended infinite recursion. The function `intsFrom` generates an infinite list of integers starting from a given number, and `take` is used to take the first 5 elements.  However, the way the `intsFrom` function is defined causes it to recursively call itself without any base case, resulting in an infinite loop.
